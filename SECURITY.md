# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support modern versions of the Crypto++. Modern versions include tip of Master and the latest release.

We also support versions of the library supplied by distributions such as Debian, Fedora, Red Hat and Ubuntu. We don't leave distros unsupported simply because we have released a new version of the library.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a security related bug in the [GitHub bug tracker](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp) or at the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/cryptopp-users).

All information will be made public. We do not withold information from users because stake holders need accurate information to access risk and place controls to remediate the risk.
